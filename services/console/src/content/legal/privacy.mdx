<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<h5>Usage and Log Information</h5>
<p>
    We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes
    information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address,
    operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or
    a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the
    Services, items you click on, pages you view, and the amount of time you
    spend on particular pages.
</p>
<h5>Cookies and Online advertising</h5>
<p>
    We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of
    "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data
    files that are stored on a user's computer or device at the request of a
    website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain
    information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block,
    erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser
    instructions or "help screen" to learn about these functions. However,
    if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie,
    you will not be able to sign in to your Bencher account or use certain
    parts of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    We may also use third parties to display and target ads, provide certain
    functionality (such as maps), or to place their own cookies and other
    tracking technologies to collect, track and analyze usage and
    statistical information from users. We are not responsible for the
    information collection practices of any third parties.
</p>
<h5>Personal Information</h5>
<p>
    We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when
    accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means
    information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly
    from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone
    number, email address, credit card, or other account number. Personal
    Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information
    (2) any publicly available information (3) information about you that is
    provided by third parties (4) information that is posted to publicly
    accessible areas of the Services, such as projects ("Projects").
</p>
<h5>Publicly Posted Information</h5>
<p>
    Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or
    via your Projects may become publicly available and is no longer
    considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in
    your Projects or any other interactive areas may be made publicly
    available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such
    public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such
    information publicly, and you should assume that such information will
    be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to
    locate information online (e.g., Internet Archive).
</p>
<h3>Using Information Collected</h3>
<h5>Non-Personal Information</h5>
<p>
    We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated
    or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad
    targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer
    service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and
    gather demographic information for aggregate use. Third-party ad
    platforms may use this information for a similar purpose, but you should
    follow up with third parties and confirm their information collection
    and usage practices directly. We may freely publish, disclose, and use
    information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or
    anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.
</p>
<h5>Personal Information</h5>
<p>
    We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to
    process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information,
    products, and services you request, to administer and assist us with the
    operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information
    was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news
    relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send
    you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell,
    or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties
    for direct marketing purposes.
</p>
<h5>Third Party Service Providers</h5>
<p>
    In the event that we engage with third-party service providers in
    connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with
    such service providers who need access to such information to carry out
    their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or
    verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify
    your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share
    Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to
    us that you wish to receive information from such parties (2) you
    otherwise give us your consent to do so (3) in response to a request for
    information or a subpoena.
</p>
<h5>Text Messaging</h5>
<p>
    We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to
    the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent
    to the transmission of text messages to such number, and waive any
    rights you may have under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. You
    may, however, <a href="mailto:info@bencher.dev">contact us</a> and
    opt-out of receiving such texts.

    promotional email from Bencher by following the unsubscribe instructions
    or using the unsubscribe as within the emails we send. Please note,
    however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt-out"
    of receiving service or account-related emails from Bencher.
</p>
<h3>Requests for Information</h3>
<p>
    We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we

    for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or
    safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use
    of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger
    of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies
    disclosure of Personal Information.
</p>
<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>
    Bencher endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized
    access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical,
    electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we
    collect. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect
    the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your
    password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are
    responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your
    password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe
    your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not
    secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive
    information to us via an unsecured email.

    The Services may contain as to other websites or make available
    third-party services, including ad platforms and technologies. We are
    not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We
    encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any
    website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you
    accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible
    for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the
    privacy policy of the originating website before providing any
    information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information
    collected by us.

<p>
    Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be
    disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of
    company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or
    receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third
    parties as one of Bencher's business assets. In such an event, we will
    attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred,
    but you may not have the right to opt-out of any such transfer.
