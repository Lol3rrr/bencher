## What is Rustls?
[Rustls][rustls] is a modern Transport Layer Security (TLS) library written in Rust,
with the aim of replacing less safe alternatives such as OpenSSL.
The TLS protocol is used to provide secure communications,
typically between a web server and a client.
TLS was previously called Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
It ensures that the data transmitted between the two parties is encrypted
and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.
Therefore, it is vital for a TLS library like Rustls to be both fast and secure.

## Benchmarking Rustls
Rustls first commit was made by the project's creator [Joseph Birr-Pixton](ctz) on 02 May 2016
with the first successful TLS connection not happening until the 27th of that same month.
By that September, he was [already benchmarking Rustls][bay area rust].
With substantial performance improvements under his belt,
he did [a head-to-head benchmark comparison of Rustls vs OpenSSL][rustls vs openssl] in July 2019.

The results from that benchmark comparison are as follows:
- Rustls was 15% quicker to send data.
- Rustls was 5% quicker to receive data.
- Rustls was 20-40% quicker to set up a client connection.
- Rustls was 10% quicker to set up a server connection.
- Rustls was 30-70% quicker to resume a client connection.
- Rustls was 10-20% quicker to resume a server connection.
- Rustls used less than half the memory of OpenSSL.

Though later versions of OpenSSL have caught up on some of these benchmarks,
the biggest performance concern for the Rustls project is no longer a head-to-head comparison against OpenSSL.
Rather, their primary focus is on guaranteeing that _new_ code does not introduce a performance regression.
