## Materialized View

When I added the ability to track and visualize [Threshold Boundaries][thresholds] last year,
I had a decision to make in the database model.
There is a 1-to-0/1 relationship between a Metric and its corresponding Boundary.
That is a Metric can relate to zero or one Boundary, and a Boundary can only ever relate to one Metric.
So I could have just expanded the `metric` table to include all of the `boundary` data with every `boundary` related field being nullable.
Or I could create a separate `boundary` table with a `UNIQUE` foreign key to `metric` table.
To me the latter option felt a lot cleaner, and I figured I could always deal with any performance implications later.

These were the effective queries used to create the `metric` and `boundary` tables:

<MetricTable />

<BoundaryTable />

And it turns out "later" had arrived.
I tried to simply add an index for `boundary(metric_id)` but that did not help.
I believe the reason has to do with the fact that the Perf query is originating from the `metric` table
and because that relationship is 0/1 or put another way, nullable it has to be scanned (O(n))
and cannot be searched (O(log(n))).

This left me with one clear option.
I needed to create a materialized view that flattened the `metric` and `boundary` relationship
to keep SQLite from having to create an on-the-fly materialized view.

This is the query I used to create the new `metric_boundary` materialized view:

<MetricBoundaryView />

With this solution, I'm trading off space for runtime performance.
How much space?
Surprisingly only about a 4% increase, even though this view is for the two largest tables in the database.
Best of all, it lets me have my cake and eat it too in my source code.

[Creating a materialized view with Diesel][diesel view] was surprisingly easy.
I just had to use the exact same macros that Diesel uses when generating my normal schema.
With that said, I learned to appreciate Diesel a lot more throughout this experience.
