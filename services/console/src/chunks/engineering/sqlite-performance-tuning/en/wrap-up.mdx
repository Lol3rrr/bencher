import SqliteNewQueryPlan from "../sqlite-new-query-plan.mdx";
import RustlsEmbed from "../rustls-embed.mdx";

## Wrap Up

With the three new indexes and a materialized view added, this is what the Query Planner now shows:

<SqliteNewQueryPlan />

Look at all of those beautify `SEARCH`es all with existing indexes! ðŸ¥²

And after deploying my changes to production:

<div class="content has-text-centered">
<figure>
<img
    src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.bencher.dev/engineering/sqlite-performance-tuning/http-response-times-sql-performance-tuning.png"
    width="2368"
    height="1472"
    alt="Fixed High HTTP Response Times"
/>
<figcaption>The new HTTP response times don't even register on the old scale!</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

Now it was time for the final test.
How fast does that Rustls Perf page load?

Here I'll even give you anchor tag. Click it and then refresh the page.
