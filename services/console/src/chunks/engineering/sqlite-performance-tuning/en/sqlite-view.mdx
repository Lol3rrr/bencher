## SQLite View

When I added the ability to track and visualize [Threshold Boundaries][thresholds] last year,
I had a decision to make in the database model.
There is a 1-to-0/1 relationship between a Metric and its corresponding Boundary.
That is a Metric can relate to zero or one Boundary, and a Boundary can only ever relate to one Metric.
So I could have just expanded the `metric` table to include all of the `boundary` data with every `boundary` related field being nullable.
Or I could create a separate `boundary` table with a `UNIQUE` foreign key to `metric` table.
To me the latter option felt a lot cleaner, and I figured I could always deal with any performance implications later.

These were the effective queries used to create the `metric` and `boundary` tables:

<MetricTable />

<BoundaryTable />

And it turns out "later" had arrived.
I tried to simply add an index for `boundary(metric_id)`, but that did not help.
I believe the reason has to do with the fact that the Perf query is originating from the `metric` table
and because that relationship is 0/1 or put another way, nullable it has to be scanned (O(n))
and cannot be searched (O(log(n))).

This left me with one clear option.
I needed to create a view that flattened the `metric` and `boundary` relationship
to keep SQLite from having to do a full of the `boundary` table.

This is the query I used to create the new `metric_boundary` view:

<MetricBoundaryView />

With this solution, I created [a pre-packaged `SELECT` statement][sqlite view].
This view only caused about a 4% increase in the size of the database,
even though it is for the two largest tables.
Best of all, it lets me have my cake and eat it too in my source code.

[Creating a view with Diesel][diesel view] was surprisingly easy.
I just had to use the exact same macros that Diesel uses when generating my normal schema.
With that said, I learned to appreciate Diesel a lot more throughout this experience.
