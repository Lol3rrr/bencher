## From ORM to SQL Query

The first hurdle I ran into was getting the SQL query out of my Rust code.
I use [Diesel][github diesel] as the object–relational mapper (ORM) for Bencher.

Diesel creates parameterized queries.
It sends the SQL query and its bind parameters separately to the database.
That is, the substitution is done by the database.
Therefore, Diesel cannot provide a complete query to the user.
The best method that I found was using [the `diesel::debug_query` function][diesel debug query] to output the parameterized query:

<DieselDebugQuery />

And then hand cleaning and parameterizing the query into valid SQL:

<DieselSql />

If you know of a better way, please let me know!
This is the way that [the maintainer of the project suggested][stackoverflow diesel] though,
so I just went with it.
Now that I had a SQL query, I was finally ready to... read a whole lot of documentation.
