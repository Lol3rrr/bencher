## SQLite Query Planner

The SQLite website has [great documentation for its Query Planner][sqlite query planner].
It explains exactly how SQLite goes about executing your SQL query,
and it teaches you which indexes are useful and what operations to look out for, like full table scans.

In order to see how the Query Planner would execute my Perf query,
I needed to add a new tool to my tool belt: [`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`][eqp]
You can either prefix your SQL query with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`
or run the `.eqp on` dot command before your query.
Either way, I got a result that looks like this:

```
QUERY PLAN
|--MATERIALIZE (join-5)
|  |--SCAN boundary
|  |--SEARCH threshold USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
|  |--SEARCH model USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
|  |--BLOOM FILTER ON alert (boundary_id=?)
|  `--SEARCH alert USING AUTOMATIC COVERING INDEX (boundary_id=?) LEFT-JOIN
|--SEARCH branch USING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_branch_1 (uuid=?)
|--SEARCH measure USING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_measure_1 (uuid=?)
|--SEARCH benchmark USING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_benchmark_1 (uuid=?)
|--SEARCH testbed USING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_testbed_1 (uuid=?)
|--SCAN metric
|--SEARCH report_benchmark USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
|--SEARCH report USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
|--SEARCH version USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
|--SEARCH branch_version USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_branch_version_1 (branch_id=? AND version_id=?)
|--BLOOM FILTER ON (join-5) (metric_id=?)
|--SEARCH (join-5) USING AUTOMATIC COVERING INDEX (metric_id=?) LEFT-JOIN
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

Oh, boy!
There is a lot here.
But the three big things that jumped out to me where:

1. SQLite is creating a materialized view on-the-fly that scans the _entire_ `boundary` table
2. SQLite is then scanning the _entire_ `metric` table
3. SQLite is creating two on the fly indexes

And just how big are the `metric` and `boundary` tables?
Well they just so happen to be the two largest tables,
as they are where all the [Metrics][metrics] and [Boundaries][thresholds] are stored.

Since this was my first SQLite performance tuning rodeo,
I wanted to consult an expert before making any changes.
