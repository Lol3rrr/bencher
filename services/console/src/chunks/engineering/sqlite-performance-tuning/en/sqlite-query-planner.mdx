## SQLite Query Planner

The SQLite website has [great documentation for its Query Planner][sqlite query planner].
It explains exactly how SQLite goes about executing your SQL query,
and it teaches you which indexes are useful and what operations to look out for, like full table scans.

In order to see how the Query Planner would execute my Perf query,
I needed to add a new tool to my tool belt: [`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`][eqp]
You can either prefix your SQL query with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`
or run the `.eqp on` dot command before your query.
Either way, I got a result that looks like this:

<SqliteQueryPlan />

Oh, boy!
There is a lot here.
But the three big things that jumped out to me where:

1. SQLite is creating a materialized view on-the-fly that scans the _entire_ `boundary` table
2. SQLite is then scanning the _entire_ `metric` table
3. SQLite is creating two on the fly indexes

And just how big are the `metric` and `boundary` tables?
Well they just so happen to be the two largest tables,
as they are where all the [Metrics][metrics] and [Boundaries][thresholds] are stored.

Since this was my first SQLite performance tuning rodeo,
I wanted to consult an expert before making any changes.
