Last week, I got [feedback from a user][github bitcoin 27284]
that [their Bencher Perf Page][0xb10c perf page] was taking a while to load.
So I decided to check it out, and oh, man were they being nice.
It took sooo long to load! Embarrassingly long.
Especially for the leading [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] tool.

In the past, I've used the [Rustls Perf Page][rustls perf page] as my litmus test.
They have 112 benchmarks and [one of the most impressive Continuous Benchmarking setups out there][rustls case study].
It used to take about 5 seconds load. This time around it took... ‚è≥üëÄ ... 38.8 seconds!
With that sort of latency, I had to dig in. Performance bugs are bugs, after all!
