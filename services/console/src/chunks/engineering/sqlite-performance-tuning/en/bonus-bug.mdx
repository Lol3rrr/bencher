## Bonus Bug

I originally had a bug in [my code to create a view][sqlite view].
This is what the SQL query looked like:

<BonusBugSql />

Do you see the problem? Nope. Neither did I!

The issue is right here:

<BonusBugSqlIssue />

It should actually be:

<BonusBugSqlFix />

I was trying to be too clever,
and in my Diesel materialized view schema I had allowed this join:

<BonusBugRustSchema />

I assumed that this macro was somehow smart enough
to relate the `alert.boundary_id` to the `metric_boundary.boundary_id`.
But alas, it was not.
It seems to have just picked the first column of `metric_boundary` (`metric_id`) to relate to `alert`.

Once I discovered the bug, it was easy to fix.
I just had to use an explicit join in the Perf query:

<BonusBugRustLeftJoin />
