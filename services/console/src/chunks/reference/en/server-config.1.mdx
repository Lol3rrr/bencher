The Bencher API Server requires a JSON configuration at startup.
The configuration can be provided three ways:
- `BENCHER_CONFIG` environment variable: The value should be set to the JSON configuration
- `BENCHER_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable: The value should be set to the path of a file containing the JSON configuration
- A file containing the JSON configuration located at `./bencher.json`, relative to the server executable

If no configuration is found, then a default configuration is loaded.

To update the configuration while the server is running,
an admin can use the CLI `bencher server config update` command
which hits the [PUT `/v0/server/config` endpoint](/docs/api/server/config/#put-v0serverconfig).
All updated configurations are saved to the `BENCHER_CONFIG` environment variable
and on disk at `BENCHER_CONFIG_PATH`.

Example JSON configuration:
