## Percentage Thresholds

A Percentage Threshold (`percentage`) is the simplest Statistical Threshold.
If a new Metric is below a certain percentage of the mean (Lower Boundary)
or above a certain percentage of the mean (Upper Boundary) of your historical Metrics an Alert is generated.
Either a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both must be set.
Percentage Thresholds work best when the value of the Metric should stay within a known good range.

- ### Percentage Threshold Lower Boundary
  - A Percentage Threshold Lower Boundary can be any percentage greater than or equal to zero in decimal form (ex: use `0.10` for `10%`).
It is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you had a Percentage Threshold with a Lower Boundary set to `0.10`
and your historical Metrics had a mean of `100`
the Lower Boundary Limit would be `90` and
any value less than `90` would generate an Alert.
- ### Percentage Threshold Upper Boundary
  - A Percentage Threshold Upper Boundary can be any percentage greater than or equal to zero in decimal form (ex: use `0.10` for `10%`).
It is used when a greater value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you had a Percentage Threshold with an Upper Boundary set to `0.10`
and your historical Metrics had a mean of `100`
the Upper Boundary Limit would be `110` and
any value greater than `110` would generate an Alert.
