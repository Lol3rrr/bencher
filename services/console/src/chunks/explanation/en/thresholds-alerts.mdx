## Alerts
Alerts are generated when a new Metric is below a Threshold's Lower Boundary Limit or above a Threshold's Upper Boundary Limit.
To fail a CI build in the event of an Alert set the `--err` flag when using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand.
See [the `--err` docs](/docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--err) for more details.

### Suppressing Alerts
Sometimes it can be useful to suppress Alerts for a particular Benchmark.
The best way to do this is by adding one of these special suffixes to that Benchmark's name:

- `_bencher_ignore`
- `BencherIgnore`
- `-bencher-ignore`

For example, if your Benchmark was named `my_flaky_benchmark` then renaming it to `my_flaky_benchmark_bencher_ignore`
would ignore just that particular Benchmark going forward.
Ignored Benchmarks do not get checked against the Threshold even if one exists.
However, the metrics for ignored Benchmarks are still stored.
Continuing with our example, the results from `my_flaky_benchmark_bencher_ignore` would still be stored in the database under `my_flaky_benchmark`.
If you remove the suffix and return to the original Benchmark name,
then things will pick right back up where you left off.
