### `--branch-reset`

<br />

Reset the specified `branch`.
The primary use case for `--branch-reset` is [Relative Continuous Benchmarking][relative continuous benchmarking].
This flag conflicts with the [`--branch-start-point`][branch start point] option.

- If `branch` does not exit, it will be created.
- If `branch` does exist, the old version of `branch` will be renamed
  and a new `branch` will be created.

When a new `branch` is created it will have no historical data or Thresholds.

For example, if `feature_branch` exists without a Start Point
then using `--branch feature_branch --branch-reset`
would:

1. Rename the old `feature_branch` to `feature_branch@detached`
2. Create a new Branch named `feature_branch`
3. `bencher run` would proceed using the new `feature_branch`
