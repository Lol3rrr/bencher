### `--branch <BRANCH>`

<br />

To select a Branch, set the `--branch` option or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable
to the name, slug, or UUID for the Branch.
If the value specified is a name or slug and the Branch does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Branch must already exist.
If both are specified, the `--branch` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable.
If neither are specified then `main` is used as the default Branch.
