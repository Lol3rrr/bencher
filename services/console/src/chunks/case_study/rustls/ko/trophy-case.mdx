# Getting Started

Welcome to our official guide on how to get started with our API. This guide will cover the basics, such as:

- Setting up your API keys
- Making your first request
- Understanding our error codes

## Setting Up Your API Keys

The first step is to set up your API keys. API keys allow you to authenticate your requests. Here's how to get yours:

1. Go to the [developer portal](https://developer.example.com)
2. Click on 'Create New App'
3. Fill in the required details 
4. Click 'Create'
5. Your API keys will be displayed on the screen

## Making Your First Request

With your API keys set up, you can now make your first request. Here's an example of a basic request:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'API-Key': 'your-api-key',
  },
})
```
Remember to replace "your-api-key" with the actual API key you received.

## Understanding Our Error Codes

You may occasionally encounter errors when working with our API. We use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. You can find a complete list of our error codes in the [API Error Codes](/docs/api-error-codes) section of our documentation.

Happy coding!
