# Working with Arrays

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. In JavaScript, arrays can hold many different types of values.

## Creating Arrays

You create an array by simply assigning values to a variable.

Here is an example:

```javascript
let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

## Accessing Array Elements

You access an array element by referring to its index number. The first array element is [0].

Here is an example of how to access elements in an array:

```javascript
let name = cars[0];
```
